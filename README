Choban

Choban is a widget set for Mechanical Turk using Pyjamas. Most of the code here is for
NLP/Computational Linguistics related work but it can easily be expanded. If you have
any questions about how to use widgets or would like an example please email me at
ryan.cotterell@gmail.com as I would be more than willing to help. 

AnnotationFramework.py is a Python based webserver that can be used to load HITs locallyin order for in house annotaton if this is desired. I've found that Mechanical Turk
HITs are often designed in order to extract professional grade annotations from
arbitrary internet users and for that reason HITs often have (should have) very well 
thought out interfaces.
